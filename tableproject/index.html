  <td>Mike the Tiger: As if Tiger Stadium isn’t a fearsome enough environment, LSU has a live tiger that occasionally attends games as a mascot. Mike I was adopted from the Litte Rock (Ark.) Zoo in 1936 after the school collected a 25 cent donation from every student, totaling $750 to buy the one-year-old jungle cat. LSU is now on Mike VI, who has been part of the LSU family since 2007. He weighs around 500 pounds and is a bit temperamental, declining to enter his traveling cart to attend LSU games in 2014.</td>

  <td>n 1962, former radio broadcaster George Mooney found a quicker and more exciting way to get to Neyland Stadium than fighting the notorious Knoxville traffic. Mooney navigated his little runabout down the Tennessee River to the stadium and began the tradition that would later become the Vol Navy. Orange and white boats and yachts bearing Vol fans fill the docks on home football weekends, within sight of Neyland Stadium, one of only a few college stadiums in the country that fans can travel to by boat.</td>

  <td>The English Bulldog with the droopy face has been Georgia’s official live mascot, born and raised by the Seiler family in Savannah, Ga. since 1956. After a game that season, coach Wally Butts asked Sonny Seiler if he could use the dog he brought with him to the stadium as Georgia’s mascot and he obliged. Nearing the 60-year mark, nine different dogs have carried the UGA name and all have earned their respective place in Georgia football lore.</td>
